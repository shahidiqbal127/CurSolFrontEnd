              AI-based currency prediction on CurSol uses machine learning models, such as ARIMA, 
              to analyze historical exchange rate data and identify patterns. By studying past trends 
              and seasonal variations, the system provides users with predictions about future currency movements, 
              helping them make informed decisions about when to send money. 
              This allows users to maximize the value of their remittances based on potential rate fluctuations.
